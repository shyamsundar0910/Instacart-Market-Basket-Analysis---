## Methodology  

1. **Data Acquisition & Exploration**
   - Loaded Instacart datasets (`orders.csv`, `products.csv`, `departments.csv`, etc.)
   - Reviewed data completeness and representativeness

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
   - Handled missing values and duplicates
   - Performed outlier detection and variable standardization

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created derived features like reorder ratio, order frequency, and average basket size
   - Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction

4. **Clustering Analysis**
   - Implemented K-Means to group similar customers based on purchasing behavior
   - Validated clusters using silhouette score and visualization
